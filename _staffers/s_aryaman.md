Hey Everyone! My name is Aryaman and I am a 3rd year Data Science Major from Delhi, India. I'm excited to be a tutor for DSC40A because this is the most interesting class I have taken so far. Outside the classroom, I love a good debate about which tennis player is the best of all time (its Nadal!).
