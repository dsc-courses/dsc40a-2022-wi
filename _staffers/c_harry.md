Hello! My name is Harry and I am a Second Year from majoring in Applied Mathematics and minoring in Data Science. I was born in Seoul, South Korea but moved to Hong Kong when I was 10, so I call both cities my home. I am excited to tutor DSC 40A this quarter because it was my favourite class in the UCSD DSC programme so far. I am an avid sports fan, including Esports, love talking and debating about them!
