Hi there! My name is Wenqi Sun (Preferred name: Clara), fourth year Marshall college student with major in Joint Major of Mathematics & Economics and minor in Data Science. DSC40A has been my favorite Data Science class and I believe it's a good foundation for the further learning. Fun fact about me - I'm learning to make various desserts these days and am gaining weights (happily) :)
