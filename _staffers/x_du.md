Hi, I am Du! I am a senior studying Data Science here at UCSD. This is my 5th time tutoring DSC40A, and I believe this will be a really helpful class to start in the field of data science and machine learning. I am excited to meet you guys and feel free to ask any questions about the class or anything. During my free time, I like to play acoustic guitar and listen to some jazz music. Feel free to share your music albums to me as well!
