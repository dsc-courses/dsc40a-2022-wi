Hi everyone! I’m Oren, a third year student double majoring in Data Science and Economics. I’m originally from San Jose, California, and in my spare time I enjoy playing basketball, cooking, and exploring the city with my friends. When I took DSC 40A, tutors and TA’s helped me to understand concepts that I never thought I could, and I'm super excited to have the opportunity to offer that same help to you! Looking forward to working with you all :)
