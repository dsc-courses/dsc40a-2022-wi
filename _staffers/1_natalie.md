I'm born and raised in San Diego, earned my Bachelors in Statistics from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and am currently a CSE and Artificial Intelligence Masters student. This is my fifth time TAing for Professor Tiefenbruck, and my third time TAing for DSC 40A. DSC 40A is fun class to TA for because it teaches you the math behind some cool machine learning algorithms (for example, how gradient descent works) and I love getting to meet new people. A random fact about me is I recently became an aunt and I'm a self proclaimed "fun aunt".
