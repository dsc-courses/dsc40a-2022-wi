Hello, I'm Janine and I am excited to be teaching DSC 40A this quarter! I'm originally from New Jersey but I've been at UCSD for over ten years both as a graduate student in Math and as a faculty member in Computer Science and now Data Science.  I love this course because it gives you a sense of the power of data science in solving real-world problems and it shows you interesting applications of all that math you've spent so many years learning!
