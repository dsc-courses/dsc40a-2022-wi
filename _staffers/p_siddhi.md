Hi everyone, my name is Siddhi (pronounced like the word "city") and I'm a 4th year Data Science major! I'm originally from San Diego and have lived here for over 20 years so if you need any recommendations for anything let me know. Outside of school, I love to travel and visit art museums. I'm so excited to tutor for DSC 40A this quarter because of the interactions I'll have with you all. ðŸ˜Š
