# Calendar ğŸ“…

Coming soon!

<!-- To join remote office hours, click the Zoom link in the calendar below.

**New:** All in-person office hours are held on the second floor of the east wing of the San Diego Supercomputer Center ([map](https://g.page/SDSC_UCSanDiego?share)). Enter SDSC from the main entrance on Hopkins Drive, take the elevator up to the second floor, turn left at the kitchen, and meet in the common area. You may need a code to enter the building; see [this post on Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/c/GF82D3B2E/feed/17) for the code. Make sure to hit the # key after typing in the code.

To attend in-person office hours, put your name on the queue by creating a ticket at [autograder.ucsd.edu](https://autograder.ucsd.edu).
