# Calendar ðŸ“…

This calendar contains information on course meetings and office hours (OH). For the start of the quarter, everything will be held remotely at this [Zoom link](https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/91995392966?pwd=M0RGN0t6U21qb0ZLNkMzRHF0QU55UT09). Once campus resumes in-person instruction, we'll update these events with physical locations.

<!--Unless otherwise noted, in-person office hours are held on the second floor of the east wing of the San Diego Supercomputer Center ([map](https://g.page/SDSC_UCSanDiego?share)). Enter SDSC from the main entrance on Hopkins Drive, take the elevator up to the second floor, turn left at the kitchen, and meet in the common area. You may need a code to enter the building; see [this post on Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/c/G9E47CE15/feed/1) for the code. Make sure to hit the # key after typing in the code.-->
